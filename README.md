# Prediction-of-Surfing-Conditions
This is the result of our group for the hackathon challenge from windfinder. 
In this challenge we were asked to find out at which weather condition, people like to go surfing. <\br>
## Data
The data of weather and pageviews for every day of four years. And this data for a number of different spots.

## Challenge
We tried to predict the pageviews from the date and the wheater and use that to inidcate a good surfing day.
The results of this work can be found in this repository
